This package is only necessary to run Pywikibot from a fully self-sufficient
(no other dependencies other than python 2.6+) directory.
This is especially useful on Windows.

Usually - under normal circumstances - these packages should be installed 
separately elsewhere in the OS by the standard package managing system.

If you want to run the rewrite as a stand-alone package, you may download
dependencies into the externals/ subdirectory, and they will automatically
be used by the pwb.py script.
